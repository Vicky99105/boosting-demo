    #### Summary

    - We use weak learners that are of high bias and low variance.
    - The learners are combined using additive combination
    - In context of regression
        - Scenario:  Instead of predicting loan status, we want to predict for how much amount loan shall be sanctioned
        - Model is build in stages where
            - Stage 0 is mean model
            - Stage 1 model (low depth DT) is built on top of errors (residuals) of stage 0 model
            - Similarly, Stage 2 model  is built on top of errors of stage 1 model… and so on.
            - This continues till Stage M (i.e M models)
    - We also see boosting in context of classification where instead of numerical target variable, we have class and Probability.
