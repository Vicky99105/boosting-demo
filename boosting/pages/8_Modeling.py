        #### Let's discuss key points for each algo:

        **Logistic Regression**

        - It works well in high dimensionality space

        - May not be able to capture non linearity of data present

        **K-NN**

        - As banks operate on data scale of million of rows,

        - K-NN might fail here as inference time may go up.


        **Decision Tree**

        - Works well with combination of categorical and numerical data

        - Can capture non linearity of data using non linearity decision boundary
