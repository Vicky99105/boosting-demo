        **Impurity based feature engineering** and **Permutation based Feature engineering** both explain which feature is important for model performance.
        - They **don’t** explicitly explain **which feature played a more important role in predicting a particular instance**.



        For that, we can use techniques like **LIME and SHAP**.

        Let’s look into how LIME does it.

        ___

        #### LIME

        In order to get interpretability of which feature played important role for a particular instance:
        - It generates set of similar instances (perturbations by adding noise or sampling from distribution) i.e. small variations of given instance
        - It then uses the model to predict output of these generated instances
        - It then fit easily interpretable model (Log reg, DT) those these generated instances and their predicted output
        - Using this interpretable model, it can easily identify features which contribute the most for predicting this instance.
