        #### Conclusion:

        We can get the following **insights** from the plots above:

        - There are two columns with **missing values** i.e. **loan interest rate** and **person employment length**

        - Data set is **imbalanced** with **majority** of data belonging to **non default****  i.e class 0

        - **Distribution** of all numerical features are **right skewed**.

        - Majority of people who are applying for a loan don’t own a home. They are either living on rent or mortgage.

        - There is a small distinction between loan status when we look at medians of loan status and loan percent income

            - Higher loan interest are more likely to default

            - Higher loan percent income are more likely to default.
